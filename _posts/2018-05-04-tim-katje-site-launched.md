Just following a tutorial to setup my first markdown-based website, hosted on GitHub.  We'll see if I turn it into something, over time, or just abandon it once I feel I've learned enough about.

In other news, my first blog post, ever (unless my decades-old LiveJournal still exists) has occured on May 4th, 2018... 


"May the Fourth be with you"

Peace and long life,

-Tim
